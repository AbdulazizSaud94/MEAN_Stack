                A ninja (忍者, Japanese pronunciation: [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (忍び, [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent or
                mercenary in feudal Japan. The functions of a ninja included espionage, deception, and surprise
                attacks. Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the
                honor of the samurai. Though shinobi proper, as specially trained spies and mercenaries, appeared in
                the 15th century during the Sengoku period (15th–17th centuries), antecedents may have existed as
                early as the 12th century.
